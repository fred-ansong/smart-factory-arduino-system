# smart-factory-arduino-system
An Arduino-based smart factory simulation that autonomously regulates environmental variables — temperature, water level, and cooling — using LEDs as heat, a fan, water pump, and sensors. Designed to maintain system equilibrium through real-time monitoring and control logic.
